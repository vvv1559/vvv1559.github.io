                    As a part of development team I worked on ETL processes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Took a main part in the planing and development of high loaded service (more than 160 millions
                    events per day).
                    Main goals of this service are:
                    collect, transform and store statistic information about music streams from services such as:
                    Spotify, Apple music, Google music, Amazon music and more;
                    and provide access to this information to our costumers and other parts of company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most important part of my work is discussion with product owners and customer's support,
                    give answers for questions, solve customers problems and collect information about customers needs.
                    And, as a next step, conversion of this information to tasks and discussions with my teammates
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a teammate I took a responsibility for processes of task management, pre-production testing and
                    production deployments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a developer, I analysed problems and implemented important changes to our processing tools.
                    Current solution is helps to our customers to get information 100 times faster with 5 times less 
                    resources consumption.

                    As a part of development team I took a part with development and support of Yandex.Market

                <p>
                    With team I took a part in the planning, support, optimisation and development of a high-loaded (500
                    thousand
                    lines of logs per second, 1.5 million metrics per minute), geographically distributed complex of
                    services.
                    Main goal of service is collecting, parsing the application's logs and building metrics
                    based on this data. This service helps for all teams of company to watch and monitor states of
                    applications,
                    makes releases more safe, gives tools for A/B tests monitoring and more.

                <p>
                    I took a main part in collection of requirements and implementation of solutions for make a
                    development tools.
                    Those tools made a development and maintenance of application with a unified way.
                    Also, they helped to make releases of new applications more faster, reduced complexity of
                    application
                    maintenance and helped to create another tools set for create CI / CD processes by "1-click"
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a team I took a part in the development of complex of services for administrating applications,
                    and managing their CI / CD processes. I took a main part in implementation of subsystem
                    for accounting components and resources.
                    I started a history of common library of React components for our front-end part.
                    This helped to speed up development and make solid interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I took a part in the development of the open-source component "Graphouse".
                    This component allows to use the ClickHouse database as a metric data storage system for Graphite.
                    At the end people can build very powerful and effective systems for time-series data with the
                    graphite-API for data representation.

                    With another team I took a part in the development of a high-loaded, distributed billing system

                <p>
                    I suggested and we implemented with my colleagues a lot of optimisations and automatisation that
                    helped
                    to deliver our product faster with a low latency. For example service for quick deploying test
                    environments,
                    as well as migrating data to a new kernel version with minimal human involvement.

                    I took a main part in implementation of integrations with third-party systems through REST-API,
                    as well as T-SQL scripts with scheduled work or events.
                    This helped to company to make organisation changes more soft and clear.
                    Also, it helped to collaborate powers of separate application into single effective solution.

                <p>
                    I implemented tools for asynchronous SMS notification, by implementing the SMPP-protocol

                    This helped to give our users more effective communication and notification about work statuses.

                    This helped to increase efficiency of exchange between material and financial accounting systems.
