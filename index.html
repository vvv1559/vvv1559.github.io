            <p>As a team lead, I was working on the organisation of the development inside of the team: setting up the road map, defining priorities (collaborative with the product manager), helping the team to get answers on the questions. As a part of my work, I had 1 on 1 meeting with my teammates to help them with problems, questions and planning their development and grows.</p>
            
            <p>As a lead engineer, I participated in cross-team activities, such as: defining the common frameworks, code-styles, review proposals of new services, mentoring and training of developers.</p>
            
            <p>As a developer, I analyzed and set up the architecture of a new solution for integration with a European trains provider. This helped our company significantly improve the coverage of train trips for our customers. As a result, we got an effective and scalable solution, with the highest test coverage in the company.</p>
            
            <p>As a developer, I analyzed and implemented the framework for the integration of company infrastructure with 3rd party HR management systems. Based on this framework my teammates were able to implement new integrations in a short period (a few days).</p>

            <p>As a part of the development team, I took apart in the development and support of Yandex.Market billing and infrastructure products.</p>
            
            <p>With a team, I took a part in the planning, support, optimization, and development of a high-loaded (500 thousand lines of logs per second, 1.5 million metrics per minute), geographically distributed complex of services. The main goal of service is collecting, parsing the application's logs and building metrics based on this data. This service helps all teams of the company to watch and monitor states of applications, makes releases safer, gives tools for A/B tests monitoring and more.</p>
            
            <p>I took the main part in the collection of requirements and implementation of development tools. Those tools made the development and maintenance of application in a unified way. Also, they helped to make releases of new applications more faster, reduced complexity of application maintenance and helped to create another toolset for creating CI / CD processes by "1-click"</p>
            
            <p>With a team, I took part in the development of a complex of services for administrating applications and managing their CI / CD processes. I took the main part in the implementation of the subsystem for accounting components and resources. I started a history of the common library of React components for our front-end part. This helped to speed up development and make a solid interface.</p>
            
            <p>I took a part in the development of the open-source component "Graphouse". This component allows to use the ClickHouse database as a metric data storage system for Graphite. In the end, people can build very powerful and effective systems for time-series data with the graphite-API for data representation.</p>
            
            <p>With another team I took a part in the development of a high-loaded, distributed billing system for the marketplace with more than 18 millions users per month.</p>
