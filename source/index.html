            <p>Took a main part in the planing and development of high loaded service (more than 160 millions events per day). Main goals of this service are: collect, transform and store statistic information about music streams from services such as: Spotify, Apple music, Google music, Amazon music and more; and provide access to this information to our costumers and other parts of company.</p>
            
            <p>As a developer, I analysed problems and implemented important changes to our processing tools. Current solution is helps to our customers to get information 100 times faster with 5 times less resources consumption.</p>
            
            <p>As a developer, made refactoring of legacy code and tuned processing infrastructure. Those changes increased processing capacity at least 4 times.</p>
            
            <p>Most important part of my work is discussion with product owners and customer's support, give answers for questions, solve customers problems and collect information about customers needs. And, as a next step, conversion of this information to tasks and discussions with my teammates</p>
            
            <p>As a teammate I took a responsibility for processes of task management, pre-production testing and production deployments.</p>

            <p>As a part of the development team, I took apart in the development and support of Yandex.Market billing and infrastructure products.</p>
            
            <p>With a team, I took a part in the planning, support, optimization, and development of a high-loaded (500 thousand lines of logs per second, 1.5 million metrics per minute), geographically distributed complex of services. The main goal of service is collecting, parsing the application's logs and building metrics based on this data. This service helps all teams of the company to watch and monitor states of applications, makes releases safer, gives tools for A/B tests monitoring and more.</p>
            
            <p>I took the main part in the collection of requirements and implementation of development tools. Those tools made the development and maintenance of application in a unified way. Also, they helped to make releases of new applications more faster, reduced complexity of application maintenance and helped to create another toolset for creating CI / CD processes by "1-click"</p>
            
            <p>With a team, I took part in the development of a complex of services for administrating applications and managing their CI / CD processes. I took the main part in the implementation of the subsystem for accounting components and resources. I started a history of the common library of React components for our front-end part. This helped to speed up development and make a solid interface.</p>
            
            <p>I took a part in the development of the open-source component "Graphouse". This component allows to use the ClickHouse database as a metric data storage system for Graphite. In the end, people can build very powerful and effective systems for time-series data with the graphite-API for data representation.</p>
            
            <p>With another team I took a part in the development of a high-loaded, distributed billing system for the marketplace with more than 18 millions users per month.</p>
